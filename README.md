Interpreting user needs and implementing them into a program involves the entire Scrum team. It begins with the Product Owner, who is in tune with what the customer wants via market analytics, or meetings with customers to ask them directly. The product owner then creates user stories based on these needs, which the development team and testers then build code to satisfy. The methods an agile team employs in development are methods I hope to employ in my future work; I like to plan concrete objectives I can test for while working, and work in small iterations that add value to my project with each succession. If I am working in a team, I need to ensure that I'm doing what's asked of me and more, and I need to ensure that I'm communicating well with my team. This not only means fostering an environment where others feel they can provide feedback to me, but also providing feedback to other members of the team. If I have an idea I fell will help our mutual goal, I should share it, and I should feel comfortable keeping my peers in check.
